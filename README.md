# binary-thermostat
A very serious contribution to science! ☝️
I used the Arduino to measure the temperature with a thermometer sensor and output to binary.

If the red light is on, it means the number is negative.
If the red light is off, it means the number is positive.

The picture shows the thermometer in action.  The lights (starting from red side) show the value "1001000" in binary which translates to 72° F.
Not the most practical project, but it was a success.
